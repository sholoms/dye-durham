///Dye and Durham Name sorting challenge.///

Run using gradle and pass in a txt file containing the names you want sorted as a command line argument.

Clone the repo to your device and use the following code in the cli from within the dye-durham folder to run the name sorter.

<i>(when the names to be sorted are in the unsorted-names.txt inside the app folder)</i>

`./gradlew run --args="unsorted-names.txt"`

To run the tests use: 

`./gradlew test`

Build and test are automatically run on all pull requests.
